# ELK_Stack
This project is designed in order to send a bunch of information from different sources to the Elasticsearch and visualize them in Kibana.  ELK_Stack is the automated process of extracting logs/files from different sources using Filebeat, process them in Logstash ( If they are Logs), and finally load them into the Elasticsearch. The result will be visualized in Kibana.
